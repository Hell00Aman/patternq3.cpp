# patternq3.cpp
This C++ program prints a right-angled triangle pattern using numbers.  It takes an integer input n which represents the number of rows in the triangle.  For each row i (from 1 to n), the program prints numbers starting from 1 up to i.  After finishing each row, it moves to the next line.
